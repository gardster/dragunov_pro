One of the most delightful discoveries I've made while getting acquainted with Berlin is the abundance of stunning flowering trees that grace its streets. While sakura often steal the spotlight when it comes to discussing floral displays, the city is home to a rich variety of blossoms, including magnolias, plums, and pears.

There's something truly magical about the way a street is transformed when adorned with flowering trees. As a newcomer to the city, I've found that discovering these natural treasures often feels like stumbling upon a hidden gem.

Fortunately, [Tatiana Dragunova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tdragunova/) came across the [GieÃŸ den Kiez](https://www.giessdenkiez.de/) project, which focuses on tree watering. Thanks to this site, I was able to find an open government dataset containing information about all the trees in the city. After filtering out blossoms and plotting them onto a map, I made a surprising discovery: an entire street full of magnolias, not far from my current apartment. Despite walking along this street numerous times during the winter, it somehow escaped my notice for an entire month.

I hope this map inspires someone to discover new botanical treasures throughout our city.

P.S. While writing this post I came across an identical map from my mate [Slava Mazai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mazai/). He made the similar thing for [Warsaw](https://pl.kut.pub/wiosna.html);
